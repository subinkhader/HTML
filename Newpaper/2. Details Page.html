        end of an era. He contributed immensely to the enrichment of Indian

        a school of architecture in Ahmedabad that continues to be a beacon of
        <br />
        innovation and excellence. Doshi was also a great champion of the
        architectural profession who through his talks, writings, research
        <br />
        projects and advocacy kept the profession’s flag flying high. Doshi was
        born in 1927 and grew up in Pune. He studied architecture at the J J
        <br />
        School of Art, Mumbai. Starting in 1951 he worked in Paris with Le
        Corbusier and then returned to India to represent him in Chandigarh and
        <br />
        Ahmedabad. He set up his practice in 1958 in Ahmedabad and lived there
        throughout his life. He was conferred with many awards including the Aga
        Khan Award for Architecture, the Pritzker Prize and the Padma Bhushan.
